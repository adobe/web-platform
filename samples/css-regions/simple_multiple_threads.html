		<p>This is a some&shy;what con&shy;trived ex&shy;am&shy;ple that shows how mul&shy;ti&shy;ple ar&shy;bi&shy;trary col&shy;umns al&shy;low for paged con&shy;tent styl&shy;ing. Con&shy;tent can be in&shy;ter&shy;rupt&shy;ed and re&shy;sume lat&shy;er with some nav&shy;i&shy;ga&shy;tion aid to point the read&shy;er where to go. In this case the in&shy;ter&shy;rup&shy;tion is a sep&shy;a&shy;rate ar&shy;ti&shy;cle of text, but in a more com&shy;plex ex&shy;am&shy;ple there may be a paged dis&shy;play where mul&shy;ti&shy;ple ar&shy;ti&shy;cles be&shy;gin on the first page and are each con&shy;tin&shy;ued on dif&shy;fer&shy;ent pag&shy;es.</p>
		<p>Each col&shy;umn could have its own adorn&shy;ments. Here there are stat&shy;ic “con&shy;tin&shy;ued on” mark&shy;ers but with a bit of javas&shy;cript there could be foot&shy;notes for mark&shy;ers that fall in&shy;side the col&shy;umn or oth&shy;er such call&shy;outs.</p>
		<p>This par&shy;a&shy;graph prob&shy;a&shy;bly falls in the third col&shy;umn, sand&shy;wiched be&shy;tween the fill&shy;er ar&shy;ti&shy;cle col&shy;umns, but in the HTML it’s con&shy;tig&shy;u&shy;ous with the rest of the blue back&shy;ground text.</p>
